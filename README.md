# 🏭 Natural Language Processing of Safety Reports in Nuclear Power Plants

## 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes nuclear safety reports using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM) to identify and classify safety issues according to regulatory traits.

## 🎯 Key Features
- 🤖 Multiple ML/NLP approaches implemented:
  - Claude-2 LLM (79% accuracy)
  - Seed Word Model (58% accuracy)
  - Logistic Regression Model (51% accuracy)
- 📊 Analysis of Diablo Canyon Power Plant safety reports
- 🔍 Classification based on INPO safety culture traits

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Natural Language Processing
- Large Language Models (Claude-2, GPT-3.5)
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Seed Word)
